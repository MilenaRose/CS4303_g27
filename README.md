# CS4303_g27

## Getting Started
### Cloning the repository
Because this is a private repo I'd recommend using SSH so you don't have to enter your password all the time.
1. Generate an ssh key
2. Go to your gitHub settings and under "SSH and GPG keys" paste the *public* key you just generated
3. Create an empty folder somewhere on your PC and navigate to it in the terminal
4. Type git clone git@github.com:MilenaRose/CS4303_g27.git

Done!
